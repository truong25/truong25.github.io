# About
This repository is the result of my learning of HTML and CSS from CodeAcademy's HTML and CSS online courses. 
After each lesson I would try to apply what I just learned to this website. 
This website is designed to be an aid for my YouTube channel, making it more simple for users to navigate.

I am currently learning JavaScript and will begin integrating what I learned soon.

## To Do
- Currently the Wizard's page is quite heavy on images/videos and I would like to minimize that by implementing a database that holds
each item and a search function for it. 
- Make it so that the top button only appears once you're no longer at the top of the webpage (using JavaScript).
